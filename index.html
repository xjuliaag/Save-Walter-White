            My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br>
            found out he was going to die.  That it was going to happen<br>
            soon.  That it was real.  Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br>
            Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.  I guess I kind<br>
            of took him for granted or something.  I mean, our parents are<br>
            just always there.  You expect them to always be bugging you<br>
            to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br>
            try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br>
            day.  And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br>
            "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br>
            crazy.  I don't feel that way now.  Everything's different since<br>
            Dad got his diagnosis.  Since I realized that one day in the<br>
            near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="texto2">Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that<br>
            question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-<br>
            sible. One day he won't be here to ask.     Now I feel lucky when I hear<br>
            his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-<br>
            ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.

            My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.<br>
            I mean, super brainiac annoying.  He knows the most random stuff.  Like<br>
            how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.<br>
            And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it<br>
            takes up about 9% more space.  Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt<br>
            into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level<br>
            will go down.  He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He<br>
            doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.<br>
            I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is.  He likes to cook<br>
            because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-<br>
            cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he<br>
            goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.<br>
            He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.
        </p>
        <p class="texto3">
            The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always had to<br>
            hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.<br>
            (Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser<br>
            shoes he always wears).  Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.<br>
            Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with teachers.<br>
            The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does,<br>
            and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That's<br>
            how he is at home and at school.  I only just figured out what a good qual-<br>
            ity that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what<br>
            made me brave, too when I was younger.  Whether I wanted to be or not.<br>
            Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because of<br>
            my dad being a teacher there I was different.  I realize two things now.<br>
            First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal.<br>
            And two, he's the right dad for me.  I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-<br>
            cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be with a<br>
            lot of other dads I've met.  They'd be disappointed because they're into<br>
            sports or whatever.  I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability but you sure<br>
            wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It<br>
            makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't care<br>
            about what the kids at school say anymore.  The bottom line is he's a good<br>
            teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he<br>
            cares.  After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the<br>
            best.  I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do<br>
            for a long time.  For him, for his students, and for me and my family.
        </p>
        <p class="texto3">
            It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer.  Not<br>
            that there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as that,<br>
            but it was sure a bad time for us.  My mom was pregnant with what she calls<br>
            a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she's a newborn baby she's<br>
            actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help pay<br>
            all the regular bills. And that was before he got his diagnosis.  We don't<br>
            have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical bills.  And<br>
            my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take char-<br>
            ity.  That's why I'm doing this.  Not because I want to make him mad or<br>
            upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.
        </p>
        <p class="texto3">
            One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more than a<br>
            regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones) don't<br>
            take insurance.  I think that's wrong.  I mean, one of the big reasons why<br>
            my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he<br>
            didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about my<br>
            dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself.  But we want him<br>
            around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as<br>
            possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life.  And we<br>
            can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have with<br>
            him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my dad.  I want her to
            know him for herself.
